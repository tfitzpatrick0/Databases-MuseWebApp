    <h2> 1. Description </h2>
    We will make use of the database for music/songs with attributes including artists, ISRC number, album title, and
    other properties. The purpose of this project is to let users know a plethora of songs that they would like based on
    their searches/saved genre/title/album/artist. Users will own personal accounts through which they are given the six
    functionalities to be mentioned below.

    <h2> 2. Usefulness </h2>

    This website is a great resource for artists with the compiled statistics page. For example, users can view how a
    certain song has grown in popularity and/or gone out of trend. This combines different metrics into a single page
    that
    is easy to review. The website will also be able to help users make their libraries unique and catered to their own
    interests, as well as to receive recommendations for new songs that are based off of their current playlist and
    recent
    searches. Our project is different from other applications that simply make music search and listening convenient,
    as
    we incorporate in statistics for each song searched. Many other applications offer these type of statistical data,
    but
    we aim to make our application different by rendering it more "readable" and "interactable" for the user to visually
    understand the data.

    <h2> 3. Realness </h2>

    The “real data” of songs and their identifiable attributes will be accessed through <a
      href="https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs">Spotify 1.2M+</a>. The data for the user viewed
    song’s Likes and Dislikes will be scraped from Youtube, number of streams from Spotify, and Gold and Platinum -
    RIAA,
    and song lyrics from Google.
    <br><br>
    Our database consists of songs and information about them, such as title, genre, language, duration, ISRC code
    (unique
    identifier), the album it belongs to, the credited artist, and the record label that owns the song. The database
    will
    also contain statistics about each song, including monthly streams, all time streams, awards, and popularity
    (likes/dislikes).

    <h2> 4. Functionality </h2>

    Basic Functionality:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Insert:</b> users can add a song to their personal library</li>
      <li><b>Update:</b> users can update their account info and update their personal library information</li>
      <li><b>Delete:</b> users can remove a song from a personal library/delete an entire personal library/delete their
        account</li>
      <li><b>Search:</b> users can filter their search by song/album title, artist name, or genre</li>
    </ul>

    Advanced Functionality:

    <ul>
      <li>Smart playlist generator: users can search by the artist name, album name, length/duration of the song and a
        year range of the recording</li>
