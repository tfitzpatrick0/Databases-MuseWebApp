<h2> 1. Description </h2>
We will make use of the database for music/songs with attributes including artists, ISRC number, album title, and other properties. The purpose of this project is to let users know a plethora of songs that they would like based on their searches/saved genre/title/album/artist. Users will own personal accounts through which they are given the six functionalities to be mentioned below.

<h2> 2. Usefulness </h2>

This website is a great resource for artists with the compiled statistics page. For example, users can view how a certain song has grown in popularity and/or gone out of trend. This combines different metrics into a single page that is easy to review. The website will also be able to help users make their libraries unique and catered to their own interests, as well as to receive recommendations for new songs that are based off of their current playlist and recent searches. Our project is different from other applications that simply make music search and listening convenient, as we incorporate in statistics for each song searched. Many other applications offer these type of statistical data, but we aim to make our application different by rendering it more "readable" and "interactable" for the user to visually understand the data.

<h2> 3. Realness </h2>

The “real data” of songs and their identifiable attributes will be accessed through <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs">Spotify 1.2M+</a>. The data for the user viewed song’s Likes and Dislikes will be scraped from Youtube, number of streams from Spotify, and Gold and Platinum - RIAA, and song lyrics from Google.
<br><br>
Our database consists of songs and information about them, such as title, genre, language, duration, ISRC code (unique identifier), the album it belongs to, the credited artist, and the record label that owns the song. The database will also contain statistics about each song, including monthly streams, all time streams, awards, and popularity (likes/dislikes).

<h2> 4. Functionality </h2>

Basic Functionality:
<ul>
    <li><b>Insert:</b> users can add a song to their personal library</li>
    <li><b>Update:</b> users can update their account info and update their personal library information</li>
    <li><b>Delete:</b> users can remove a song from a personal library/delete an entire personal library/delete their account</li>
    <li><b>Search:</b> users can filter their search by song/album title, artist name, or genre</li>
</ul>

Advanced Functionality:

<ul>
    <li>Smart playlist generator: users can search by the length/duration of the song, keywords from the song lyrics, year range of the recording, and personal library attribution.</li>
    <li>Displaying statistics: scrape statistical information from spotify/genius/youtube and display relevant information to users, generate graphs and charts</li>
    <li>Integrating OAuth and Spotify API into playlist search features</li>
